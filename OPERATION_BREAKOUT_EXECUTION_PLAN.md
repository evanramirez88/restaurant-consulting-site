## LEAD PRIORITIZATION

1. **Adam Holmes referrals** (warm) - Immediate
2. **Past/existing clients** (referral requests) - Week 1
3. **Massachusetts Toast users** (support plans) - Week 1-2
4. **Massachusetts competitor POS** (conversions) - Week 2-3
5. **Florida Toast users** (remote support) - Week 3-4
6. **National Toast users** (remote support) - Ongoing
7. **National competitor POS** (referrals + menu builds) - Ongoing

---

## CONTINGENCY LEVERS

### If Conversion Underperforms (<2% response)
1. Double volume → 1,000 emails/week
2. Add phone → Cold call non-responders after 7 days
3. Add paid ads → $500-1,000/month Google Ads
4. Lower price → Reduce support to $300/mo for quick closes

### If Fulfillment Overloads
1. Build automation faster
2. Raise prices (reduce demand)
3. Batch similar tasks
4. Prioritize annual prepays (money now, work later)
