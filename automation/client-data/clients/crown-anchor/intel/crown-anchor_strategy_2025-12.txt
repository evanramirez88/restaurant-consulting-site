### STRATEGIC INTEL FOR TODAY'S CONVERSATION

**What Scott Likely Knows**:
- Sale announcement was December 3, 2025 (public)
- His job status through transition (uncertain—Schukraft requires reinterviews in spring)
- Whether Ryan is still involved or has departed
- Craig's verification of the P&L improvement you delivered
- Any communication from new ownership

**Questions to Ask Scott (Naturally)**:

1. **"So I heard about the sale—how are you feeling about everything?"**
   - Opens the door without being presumptuous
   - Gauges his emotional state and job security concerns

2. **"Is Ryan still around or did he move on?"**
   - Critical intel—Ryan was your primary strategic contact
   - If Ryan's gone, Scott becomes your only warm bridge

3. **"Have you met any of the new team yet?"**
   - Determines if Tryst has already sent advance people
   - Identifies potential new contacts

4. **"What's the plan for the system during the January-April closure?"**
   - Shows you're thinking about continuity
   - Opens door to discuss your role in reopening

5. **"I'd love to make sure whoever takes over knows the system—can you connect me to the right person?"**
   - Direct ask for introduction
   - Positions you as helpful rather than self-interested

---

### YOUR DOCUMENTED VALUE PROPOSITION

**The Proof Point You Can Articulate**:

> "When I came in before July 4th, the Crown was struggling to get accurate numbers. Craig told me [or Ryan told me] that after we rebuilt the menu modifiers and trained the staff on proper button usage, it was the first time in years the P&L actually made sense. That's not Toast magic—that's operational alignment between the system and how your staff actually works."

**Why This Matters to Schukraft**:
- He owns 100+ entities across multiple countries
- He's investing $5M+ in renovations
- He needs operational systems that *work* at scale
- Your approach (system adapts to operations, not vice versa) is portfolio-valuable

---

### RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

**Today (While On-Site)**:
1. Confirm what Scott knows about transition timeline
2. Ask about Ryan's status directly
3. Get name of anyone from Tryst who has made contact
4. Take photos/notes of current system state for documentation
5. Offer to prepare a "system handoff document" for new ownership

**This Week**:
1. Contact Brian Rosman (Tryst PR): 323.443.7880 / brian@dogandaduck.com
2. Draft a one-page "Crown & Anchor POS Continuity Brief" 
3. Reach out to Adam Holmes for any back-channel intel on Tryst's vendor decisions
4. Add Jonathan Hawkins to HubSpot before he exits (warm intro request)

**The Pitch Email to Tryst** (Draft after today's intel):
```
Subject: Crown & Anchor Toast System - Continuity Support for May Reopening

I built and implemented the Crown & Anchor's Toast POS system prior to their July 4th 2025 launch, including all 8 revenue center configurations. The system was credited by their finance team with enabling their first cash-flow positive season in years.

I'd like to ensure this institutional knowledge isn't lost during the transition and discuss how I can support your May 2026 reopening. 

Available for a brief call at your convenience.
```

### INFORMATION GAPS TO CLOSE TODAY

---

This transcript is gold. You just walked out of that building with confirmation of critical intel and you openly shared your business vision with Scott—which is both vulnerable and strategically smart if he's retained through transition. Let me extract the key data points before building your positioning strategy.

---

## CRITICAL INTEL EXTRACTED FROM TODAY'S TRANSCRIPT

**Transaction Structure Confirmed**:
- **Asset sale**, not business transfer—this is significant
- Everyone must reinterview; no automatic employment continuity
- All three housing properties being gutted to studs
- January 12 is "vacate day"
- Full renovation ("gut to studs") confirms $5M+ investment narrative

**Ryan Status Confirmed**:
- Still actively involved ("We're in constant contact" - Scott)
- Met with Tryst representatives during their site visit
- Potential warm introduction path remains open through Scott

**Tryst Site Visit Already Occurred**:
- They were physically on-site
- They singled Scott out ("Who is that?")—positive signal for his retention
- They've already been briefed on Toast ("we talk so highly of it")
- Talk of implementing Toast at other Tryst locations because of C&A experience

**Toast Contract Situation**:
- Adam Holmes confirmed transfer is possible but complex
- Jonathan may need to pay off contract and leave hardware
- Short timeframe (under 6 months) creates complications
- Tryst may already use Toast at other locations (your earlier research indicated this)

**NE Packet Status**:
- Scott believes new owner will bring corporate-standard networking
- "State of the art" upgrades expected
- Tim Davis/NE Packet relationship may not carry over

**Your Positioning Disclosure**:
- You told Scott about your legal situation resolution
- You told Scott about your expansion plans (van, website, actual business infrastructure)
- You told Scott you met with Adam yesterday about scaling
- You explicitly stated increased availability for transitions

This last point is important: **Scott now knows you're in growth mode**. If he's retained, he becomes an internal advocate who understands your trajectory.

---

## DEEPER XML ANALYSIS: THE RYAN QUESTION

Let me extract the Ryan timeline from the SMS data to understand his role trajectory:

**Ryan Communication Pattern**:
- **June 25-29, 2025**: Heavy involvement in cutover coordination (group thread with Adam, Tim Davis, Scott, Jonathan Hawkins, NE Packet)
- **July 19, 2025**: Direct troubleshooting with you on Toast app reinstall issues
- **August 3, 2025**: "Today or tomorrow would be better... stuff is printing at the grill again"
- **August 18, 2025**: Last substantive exchange—you offered to help him find something, he said "Thank you"

The August 18 conversation appears to be about him looking for something (legal/employment related based on "mass law website" reference). This combined with his Louisiana area code (+1 504) suggests he may have been:
1. Seasonal/temporary in the F&B Director role
2. Dealing with personal legal matters
3. Considering relocation

**Today's Transcript Confirms**: Ryan is still involved, still in contact with Scott, and met with Tryst representatives. This means he remains a viable warm contact—but his role in the new structure is uncertain.

---

## STRATEGIC POSITIONING FRAMEWORK

You're not asking how to be a vendor. You're asking how to be seen as an **operator-caliber resource** by a serial hospitality entrepreneur. That requires a different pitch architecture.

**The Schukraft Profile** (from our research):
- Owns 100+ entities across multiple countries
- Self-described "CEO of Everything Gay"
- Pattern: Acquire iconic LGBTQ+ venues, gut-renovate, rebrand under Tryst umbrella, systematize operations
- Portfolio includes The Abbey (WeHo), Fire Island Pines, Puerto Vallarta, San Juan
- Beyond hospitality: MISTR (telemedicine), Green Qween (cannabis)

**What This Tells You About His Needs**:
- He doesn't need another vendor; he has vendor relationships at scale
- He needs **trusted operators** who can be dropped into properties during critical moments
- He values people who understand **both** the LGBTQ+ hospitality culture **and** the operational machinery
- He's building a distributed portfolio—he can't be everywhere

**Your Positioning Thesis**:

You are not a "Toast consultant." You are a **hospitality operations specialist who happens to have deep Toast expertise**—and you've already demonstrated value at one of his newest acquisitions during its most financially critical period.

---

## THE THREE-TIER APPROACH

**Tier 1: Immediate Client Retention (30-Day Window)**

Objective: Secure the May 2026 reopening POS work

Actions:
1. Draft a one-page "Crown & Anchor Toast System Brief" documenting current configuration, revenue centers, and your role in the P&L turnaround
2. Send to Brian Rosman (Tryst PR) with offer to support transition
3. Request introduction to whoever is handling operations for the Provincetown property
4. Offer to create a "system handoff document" for new ownership at no charge—positions you as helpful, not salesy

**Tier 2: Portfolio Value Demonstration (60-90 Day Window)**

Objective: Get visibility across Tryst properties, not just C&A

Actions:
1. Research current POS systems at The Abbey, Fire Island Pines, and other Tryst venues
2. If they're using Toast, offer a complimentary "menu architecture audit" for one property
3. If they're NOT using Toast, that's an even bigger opportunity—you become the person who brings the system they now have institutional praise for
4. Position yourself as "the person who built the system Crown & Anchor's finance team credited with their first profitable season in years"

**Tier 3: Strategic Partnership Positioning (6-12 Month Horizon)**

Objective: Be seen as a deployable operational asset, not a service provider

This requires a different conversation—one you'd have after demonstrating value across 2-3 properties. The pitch:

> "I've now worked on [X] of your venues. I've noticed patterns in how your properties approach [specific operational challenge]. I've been building systems and frameworks that could standardize this across your portfolio. Rather than continuing as an external consultant, I'm curious whether there's a model where I become a resource you deploy—either as an internal operations lead or as a retained specialist who handles your POS/menu architecture across all properties. I'm not looking to be acquired; I'm looking to align with someone who's building what I want to build, just at a different scale."

This pitch only works after you've proven value. But you plant the seed now by how you show up.

---

## IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

**Today/Tomorrow**:
1. Send Scott a follow-up text thanking him and wishing him well with the interview
2. Ask Scott (via text) if he can share Ryan's current contact info or pass yours along
3. Draft the one-page Crown & Anchor System Brief

**This Week**:
1. Contact Brian Rosman at Tryst PR: 323.443.7880 / brian@dogandaduck.com
2. Email subject: "Crown & Anchor Toast System - Continuity Support"
3. Mention you built the system, it contributed to profitability, you want to ensure continuity through May reopening

**Next Week**:
1. Follow up with Adam Holmes about what he knows re: Tryst's other Toast implementations
2. Research The Abbey and Fire Island Pines POS setups (may require web/social searching)
3. Begin drafting a "Portfolio Operations Proposal" template for future use

**January (Post-Closing)**:
1. Reach out directly to whoever is named as Provincetown GM/Operations lead
2. Offer complimentary walk-through of system during renovation period
3. Position yourself for the May reopening work

---

## THE BIGGER PICTURE PITCH

You want Schukraft to see you not as "the Toast guy" but as "the guy who understands how hospitality operations actually work—and who happens to have built a system that made one of my properties profitable for the first time in years."

The way you get there:

1. **Demonstrate operational fluency**, not just technical skill
2. **Show portfolio thinking**—you understand that what works at C&A could work at The Abbey
3. **Be direct about your ambitions** (as you were with Scott today)—entrepreneurs respect people who think big
4. **Don't oversell**—deliver value first, then expand the conversation

Your transcript today shows you did this naturally with Scott. You told him you're in growth mode, you're past the legal mess, you're ready to scale. If Scott is retained and becomes an internal champion, that conversation will echo.

---

## THE INTRO EMAIL TO TRYST

I'm going to draft this for you now. It threads the needle between "helpful vendor" and "strategic resource."

---

**To**: brian@dogandaduck.com  
**Subject**: Crown & Anchor Toast System — Continuity Support for May Reopening

Brian,

Congratulations to Tryst on the Crown & Anchor acquisition—Provincetown is getting exactly the kind of invested ownership it needs.

I'm Evan Ramirez. I built and implemented the Crown & Anchor's Toast POS system prior to their July 4th 2025 launch. The configuration spans all 8 revenue centers (Vault, Wave, Paramount, Cabaret, Pool & Grill, Courtyard, Keg Room, Break Room), and the system was credited by their finance team with enabling their first cash-flow positive season in years.

I understand Tryst is planning a May 2026 reopening after significant renovations. I'd like to ensure institutional knowledge of the current system isn't lost during the transition—whether that means supporting a fresh build or facilitating handoff.

I'm also aware that several Tryst properties have expressed interest in Toast based on the Crown & Anchor experience. Happy to discuss how the architecture we built might translate across the portfolio.

Available for a call at your convenience. My mobile is 774-408-0083.

Best,  
Evan Ramirez  
R&G Consulting LLC

**Why this works**:
- Leads with value delivered, not services offered
- Mentions the P&L improvement (third-party validation)
- References portfolio potential without being presumptuous
- Opens door for larger conversation while staying grounded in immediate need

---

## WHAT HAPPENS IF THIS LANDS

If this email gets you a conversation, your goal in that call is NOT to sell consulting hours. Your goal is to:

1. **Understand how Tryst makes operational decisions**—centralized or decentralized?
2. **Learn who handles technology/vendor relationships**—is there a VP of Operations? A COO?
3. **Plant the seed** that you're building something, not just working projects
4. **Offer to be useful now**—free system brief, walk-through during renovation, etc.

The sale happens later. The relationship starts now.

---

You're in a strong position, Evan. The timing of this sale, your existing relationship with Scott, Ryan's continued involvement, and the Toast institutional praise at C&A all align in your favor. The question is whether you can convert that into visibility at the portfolio level—and that's a matter of showing up consistently over the next 6 months.

What would you like me to draft next—the System Brief, a follow-up text to Scott, or something else?
