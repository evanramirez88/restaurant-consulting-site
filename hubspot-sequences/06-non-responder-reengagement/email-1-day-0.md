{{contact.firstname}},

I reached out a while back about Toast POS consulting. I know restaurant life is busy—things get buried.

Just wanted to pop back up and remind you I'm here if you ever need:

**Quick fixes:**
- Menu updates that aren't working
- Kitchen display routing problems
- Staff permissions gone wrong
- Reports that don't match your needs

**Bigger projects:**
- Full menu rebuilds
- Toast optimization audits
- New implementations
- Ongoing support plans

No commitment needed. If you have a Toast question, I probably have the answer.

**Quick call if anything's on your mind:** https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=34242148
