# Sequence: Non-Responder Re-engagement
## Email 2 of 2 | Day 21 (Final)

### SUBJECT LINE
Removing you from my list (unless...)

### EMAIL BODY

{{contact.firstname}},

I try not to clutter inboxes. Since I haven't heard back, I'm going to stop emailing.

But before I do—one last offer:

**Free 15-minute Toast Health Check**

I'll share my screen, look at your Toast backend, and identify 3 things you could improve. No pitch, no obligation. Just value.

If that sounds useful: https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=34242148

If not, no hard feelings. I'll keep your info on file in case you ever need Toast help down the road.

All the best,

P.S. - Even if we never work together, feel free to reply with Toast questions. I'm happy to point you in the right direction.
