{{contact.firstname}},

Following up on my note. If you're dealing with any of these:

- Slow ticket times during rush
- Kitchen display issues or missed orders
- Menu items that don't ring correctly
- Staff complaints about Toast being confusing
- Reports that don't give you what you need

I can fix them. Usually within a single remote session.

Most restaurant owners I talk to are surprised how much they're leaving on the table with a misconfigured Toast system. Things like:
- Upcharges not applying correctly
- Modifiers missing from tickets
- Online orders routing wrong
- End-of-day not matching expectations
