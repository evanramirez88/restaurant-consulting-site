### EMAIL BODY

{{contact.firstname}},

I specialize in Toast optimization for restaurants like {{contact.company}}.

After working with 50+ restaurants on Cape Cod and nationwide, I've found that **80% of Toast installations have configuration issues** that slow down service and frustrate staff.

Common problems I fix:
- Slow ticket times due to poor menu structure
- Kitchen display routing that doesn't match your workflow
- Modifier logic that confuses servers
- Missing revenue tracking and reporting

I offer a **free 15-minute System Health Check call**. I'll share my screen, review your Toast backend, and identify 3 specific improvements.

No pitch. Just value.
