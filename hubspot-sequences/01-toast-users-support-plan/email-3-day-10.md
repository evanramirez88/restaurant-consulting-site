### EMAIL BODY

{{contact.firstname}},

I won't keep emailing. But if Toast ever gives you grief, I'm one call away.

I've helped restaurants:
- Cut ticket times by 30%+ with proper menu structure
- Fix KDS routing that was driving kitchen staff crazy
- Set up reporting that actually tracks what matters
- Recover from botched Toast implementations

My rates are lower than Toast's $140/hr, and my results are better (just ask my clients).

Keeping your email on file. Good luck out there.

P.S. - If you know another restaurant owner struggling with their POS, I offer a $250 referral bonus for any introduction that turns into a project.
