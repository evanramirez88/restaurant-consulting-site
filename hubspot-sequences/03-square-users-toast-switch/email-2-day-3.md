Following up on my note about Square vs Toast.

Here's the honest comparison I give restaurant owners:

**Square works well if you:**
- Have a simple menu (under 50 items)
- Don't need kitchen displays
- Are okay with basic reporting
- Don't mind per-transaction online ordering fees

**Toast makes sense if you:**
- Have a complex menu with modifiers
- Need kitchen display routing
- Want real restaurant analytics (food cost, labor %)
- Plan to grow (multiple revenue centers, catering, etc.)
- Want online ordering without giving up margin

The switch isn't as hard as you might think. Most of my clients are live on Toast within 2-3 weeks, with zero downtime on their current system until we're ready.
