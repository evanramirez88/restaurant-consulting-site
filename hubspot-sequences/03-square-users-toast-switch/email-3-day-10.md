### EMAIL BODY

{{contact.firstname}},

I'll leave you alone after this. Just wanted to make sure you have my info if you ever want to explore Toast.

Quick summary of what I do:
- Free consultation to assess if Toast makes sense
- Full implementation if you decide to switch
- Ongoing support plans for peace of mind
- Lower rates than Toast's internal team

No pressure, no hard sell. Just expertise when you need it.

**My site:** ccrestaurantconsulting.com

And if you know another restaurant owner thinking about POS changes, I offer a **$250 referral bonus** for introductions.

Best of luck,
