Outgrowing Square?

{{contact.firstname}},

Square is great for getting started. But once a restaurant grows, its limitations become painful:

- No true kitchen display system
- Limited menu modifier logic
- Basic reporting that doesn't track food cost
- No integrated payroll or scheduling
- Online ordering fees that add up fast

**Toast is built specifically for restaurants.** It's what serious operators switch to when they're ready to scale.

I help restaurants make that transition smoothly. I've done 50+ Toast implementations—I know what goes wrong and how to prevent it.

What I handle:
- Complete menu build (I'll match your Square menu structure, improved)
- Hardware setup and network configuration
- Staff training that actually sticks
- Go-live support so your first day isn't chaos

Plus, I have Toast partner credits that can offset your project cost.
