One more thought before I leave you alone:

If you're already past your install and things aren't working right, that's actually my specialty. **I fix more broken Toast systems than I set up new ones.**

Common post-install fixes:
- Rebuilding menus that slow down service
- Fixing kitchen display routing
- Setting up reports that actually help you manage labor and food cost
- Training staff who "learned" from Toast's 1.5 hour training (not enough)

**If your install went well** — great, ignore this email.

**If something feels off** — let's talk: https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=34242148

I also offer ongoing support plans (Toast Guardian) starting at $125/month. Think of it as insurance against Toast disasters.

Good luck with the new system.
