{{contact.firstname}},

Following up about your Toast implementation. A few things to think about:

**What Toast's team typically gets wrong:**
- Menu structure (they build what you give them, not what works best)
- Modifier logic (items that should auto-fire, don't)
- Kitchen routing (wrong items on wrong screens)
- Coursing/firing rules (appetizers and entrees arriving together)
- Revenue center setup (catering, private events, online mixed together)

**What I do differently:**
- I ask questions about how your kitchen actually works
- I build menus that match your service flow
- I configure KDS routing for YOUR ticket times, not generic settings
- I train staff on the why, not just the how

My clients typically see 20-30% faster ticket times than restaurants using Toast's default setup.
