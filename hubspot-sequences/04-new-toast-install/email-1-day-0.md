### EMAIL BODY

{{contact.firstname}},

Congratulations on choosing Toast for {{contact.company}}. It's the right platform.

Quick warning: **Toast's internal onboarding team is overwhelmed and undertrained.**

I've rescued dozens of restaurants from botched Toast setups. Common problems I see:
- Menu builds that don't match how your kitchen works
- Modifier logic that confuses servers
- KDS routing that creates bottlenecks
- Permissions that let anyone void tickets
- Reports that don't track what matters

**I'm an independent Toast specialist.** I build menus properly, configure kitchens correctly, and train your staff thoroughly.

My rate is lower than Toast's $140/hr, and my results are better.

**Before your install date, let's talk:** https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=34242148

Even a 15-minute call can help you avoid the biggest mistakes.
