### EMAIL BODY

{{contact.firstname}},

I help restaurants switch from Clover to Toast—and I handle the entire transition.

**Why Toast?**
- Industry-leading restaurant-specific features
- Better reporting and analytics
- Integrated online ordering that actually works
- Kitchen display systems built for real kitchens
- Payroll, scheduling, and inventory all in one place

**Why work with me instead of Toast directly?**

I've done 50+ Toast implementations and I know every pitfall to avoid. Toast's internal onboarding team is overwhelmed and undertrained—I've rescued dozens of restaurants from botched setups.

Plus, I have a **$1,000 partner credit** I can apply to your project.

My rate is lower than Toast's $140/hr, and my results are better.

**15-minute call to see if it's a fit:** https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=34242148
