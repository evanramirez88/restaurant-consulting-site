### EMAIL BODY

{{contact.firstname}},

I'll stop here. But wanted to leave you with this:

The restaurants I've switched from Clover to Toast typically see:
- 20-30% faster ticket times
- Fewer order errors
- Better labor cost tracking
- Online ordering revenue they actually keep

If the timing isn't right now, I understand. Restaurant life is busy.

But when you're ready to explore options, my calendar is always open:

And if you know another restaurant owner frustrated with their POS, I offer a **$250 referral bonus** for introductions that become projects.

Good luck out there.
