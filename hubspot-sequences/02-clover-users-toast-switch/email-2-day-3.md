Quick follow-up. If you've been thinking about switching from Clover, here's what I typically hear from restaurant owners who made the move:

**Before Toast:**
- Limited menu customization
- Reporting that doesn't match how restaurants actually work
- Online ordering fees eating into margins
- Kitchen communication through verbal orders or paper tickets

**After Toast:**
- Menu modifiers that match how customers actually order
- Reports built for restaurant P&L
- Online ordering you own (no per-order fees)
- Kitchen displays that reduce errors and speed up service

The switch takes about 2-3 weeks with proper planning. I handle:
- Complete menu build in Toast
- Hardware setup and testing
- Staff training (servers and kitchen)
- Go-live support

**No downtime. No confusion. One call to get started:** https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=34242148
