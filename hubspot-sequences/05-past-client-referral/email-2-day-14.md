### EMAIL BODY

{{contact.firstname}},

Just a gentle reminder about my referral program.

**$250 cash** for any restaurant owner you connect me with who becomes a client.

Types of projects I take on:
- Toast implementations (new installs)
- Toast optimization (fixing broken setups)
- Menu builds and audits
- Ongoing support (Restaurant Guardian plans)
- POS switches from Clover, Square, etc.

If anyone comes to mind, just reply with their name and contact info. I'll mention you sent me (unless you'd rather I didn't).

Thanks again for your business. Always here if you need anything Toast-related.

Evan

P.S. - If your Toast system needs any tune-ups, I'm always happy to take a look. My clients get priority scheduling.
