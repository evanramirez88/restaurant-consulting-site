# Sequence: Past Client - Referral Request
## Email 1 of 2 | Day 0 (Immediate)

### SUBJECT LINE
Quick favor? (and $250 for you)

---

### EMAIL BODY

{{contact.firstname}},

Hope Toast is treating you well since we worked together at {{contact.company}}.

Quick ask: **Know any restaurant owners struggling with their POS?**

I'm expanding nationally and offering a **$250 referral bonus** for any introduction that turns into a project. Cash, Venmo, or credit toward future work—your choice.

The types of people I can help:
- Restaurants frustrated with Clover, Square, or other systems
- Places with Toast that's not working right
- Anyone about to get Toast installed (they need a real expert, not Toast's overwhelmed onboarding team)

You don't need to sell anything. Just reply with their name and number, or CC me on an intro email. I'll take it from there.

Thanks for thinking of me.
